# GLAD Voting

Implementation of GLAD model from ["Whose Vote Should Count More: Optimal Integration of Labels from Labelers of Unknown Expertise"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2009/file/f899139df5e1059396431415e770c6dd-Paper.pdf).

Work in progress:

- [ ] Check support for multi-class datasets.
- [ ] Add support for lazy datasets and mini-batch learning.
- [ ] Add support for prior distributions for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
- [ ] Add optional learning of $p(z)$.
- [ ] Recreate results on simulated datasets from the paper.
